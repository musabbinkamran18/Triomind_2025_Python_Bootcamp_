# 🐍 Python Setup Guide  

## 🔽 Step 1: Install Python  
Go to the official Python website and download the latest stable version:  
👉 [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

While installing:  
- ✅ Check **"Add Python to PATH"** (very important)  
- ✅ Keep all default checkboxes selected  
- ✅ Click *Next* until installation finishes  

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Verify Installation  
1. Open **Command Prompt (Windows)** or **Terminal (Mac/Linux)**  
2. Type:  
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```  
   If it shows a version number, Python is successfully installed. 🎉

## 💻 Step 3: Install an IDE  
Go to the official Visual Studio Code website and download it:  
👉 [Visual Studio Code Downloads](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## 🛠️ Step 4: Writing Your First Line of Code  

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**  
2. Open a folder (or create a new one) to store your Python files  
3. Create a new file with the extension **`.py`** (for example: `hello.py`)  
   - ⚠️ Without `.py`, it won’t be recognized as a Python file  
4. Type the following program:  
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```  
5. Save the program (**Ctrl + S**)  
6. Open the terminal:  
   - Either click **Terminal → New Terminal**  
   - Or press **Ctrl + `** (backtick)  
7. Run the program by typing:  
   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```  

✅ If you see **Hello, World!** printed in the terminal, congratulations — you’ve written and executed your first Python program! 🎉🐍
