# 🔠 Strings and String Methods

## 1. What are Strings❓
Strings are a **sequence of characters** enclosed in **quotes**: `' '`, `" "`, or `''' '''`.

### Types of Strings 🌀

- **Single-quoted Strings**
```python
my_string: str = 'Hello, World!'
print(my_string)
```

- **Double-quoted Strings**
```python
my_string: str = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
```
> ✅ Both single and double quotes produce the same result.

- **Triple-quoted Strings**
```python
my_string: str = '''Hello,
World!'''
print(my_string)
```
> ✅ Triple quotes can **span multiple lines.**

## 2. Escape Sequence Characters ⚡
Escape sequence characters are represented by a **backslash** `\`. They have a specific meaning in strings.

For example:
```python
print("Hello, \nTriomind!") # \n means new line
print("Hello, \tTriomind!") # \t means tab and adds space
```
