# 💯 Operators

In Python, we perform **operations** on values, like adding, subtracting, or comparing.  

- The **values** we operate on are called **operands**.  
- The **symbol** that performs the operation is called the **operator**.  

**Example:**  
```python
2 + 5
```
# Types of Operators
## 1. Arithematic Operators ➕➖✖➗
Arithematic operators are the mathematical operations 
## ➕ Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform **mathematical operations** in Python.

| Operator | Description                  | Example       | Emoji |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| `+`      | Addition                     | `2 + 3 = 5`   | ➕    |
| `-`      | Subtraction                  | `5 - 2 = 3`   | ➖    |
| `*`      | Multiplication               | `2 * 3 = 6`   | ✖️    |
| `/`      | Division                     | `6 / 3 = 2.0` | ➗    |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)          | `5 % 2 = 1`   | 💯    |
| `**`     | Exponent (power)             | `2 ** 3 = 8`  | 🌊    |
| `//`     | Floor division (quotient)    | `5 // 2 = 2`  | 🔢    |
