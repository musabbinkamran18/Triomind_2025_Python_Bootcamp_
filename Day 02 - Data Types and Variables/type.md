# 📝 Python `type()` Function (Beginner Friendly)

## 📖 What is `type()`?
The **`type()` function** in Python tells you **what kind of data** is stored inside a variable.  
Think of it as asking: *“What is this thing?”*  

For example: Is it a number 🔢, some text 📝, a list 📋, or something else?

## 🛠️ How to Use It
You write:  
```python
type(thing)
```
- Replace `thing` with your variable or value.

---

## 🔍 Simple Examples
```python
print(type(10))        # number (int)
print(type(3.14))      # decimal number (float)
print(type("Hello"))  # text (string)
print(type(True))      # True/False (boolean)
print(type([1,2,3]))   # list
```

## ✅ Why is it Useful?
- Helps you **know what kind of data** you are working with.  
- Prevents **mistakes** when mixing different types (like text and numbers).  
- Makes it easier for **beginners** to understand Python.

## 📌 Quick Tip
Whenever you are not sure about a variable, just use:

This will **show you the data type** right away!
