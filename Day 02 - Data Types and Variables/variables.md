# ğŸ«™ Variables  

Think about your kitchen: your mom stores different spices in separate containers â€” one for sugar, another for salt, and so on.  

In Python, we also have **containers**, but instead of holding spices, they hold **data values**. These containers are called **variables**.  

ğŸ‘‰ In simple words:  
A **variable** is like a box that stores a value, and you can change that value whenever you want.
